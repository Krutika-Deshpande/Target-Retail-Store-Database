# Target-Retail-Store-Database
A retail store sells small quantities of products or services to the public. This store generally buys products from the manufacturers in large quantities and sells it to the customer with a marked-up price. Retail businesses include large department stores and chains or individual shops located in every community. The store needs to keep track of the products to be ordered from the manufacturers. Based on the categories of products, the store should place order to the manufacturers. Customers buy products from the store as per their needs. The store wants to develop a database that will efficiently help to track the data of an entity. (i.e. Products, Supplier, ProductCategory, Orders etc.)
